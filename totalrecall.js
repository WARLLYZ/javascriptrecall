// 1. How do we assign a value to a variable? 
//     We use an "=" then assign the value.
// 2. How do we change the value of a variable? 
//     i would use the assignment operator "=" and then the new value of the variable
// 3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable? 
//     i would use the assignment operator "=" after the name of the new variable then the name of the existing variable
// 4. Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define? 
//    In JavaScript, declaring a variable means creating a variable and giving it a name, while defining a variable means assigning a value to it 
// 5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it? 
//    Pseudocoding is a valuable tool for anyone who is developing algorithms or programs, and can help you to write better, more efficient code. 
// 6. What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it 
//     I would say around 30% of your time thinking about how to solve a problem before you start writing code.


//b strings

let firstVariable = "Hello World";
firstVariable = 7;
let secondVariable = firstVariable;
secondVariable = "Hello again";

//the value for my first car was changed to 7 btw
console.log(firstVariable);

let yourName = "Daniel-nathen Yamamoto";
let greeting = "Hello, my name is " + yourName;
console.log(greeting);

//c boolean

const a = 4;
const b = 53;
const c = 57;
const d = 16;
const e = 'Kevin';

console.log(a < b); 
console.log(c > d); 
console.log('Name' === 'Name');
console.log(a + b === c); 
console.log(a * a === d);
console.log(e === 'Kevin');
//all logs should be true above ^^

//d the farm
let animal = "cow";
if (animal === "cow") {

    console.log("Hey! You're not a cow.");
}
